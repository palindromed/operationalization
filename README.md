# operationalization

Work on Machine Learning Operationalization.

This is a work in progress and is not a supported solution or library.

Lately my work has included moving Machine Learning from local/small scale experimentation to remote/large scale training and putting models in production. This repo is a place for me to track some of my work. 

My goal is to have options for training/deployment that are usable across projects. Spending less time thinking about ops when the project is ML.

What I'm looking for:

* Python 3 support
* Experiment/run tracking
* Model Management
* Scalable compute for training (including GPU option)
* Deployment options (REST endpoint, batch, etc.)
* Ability to automate this process (CI/CD)
